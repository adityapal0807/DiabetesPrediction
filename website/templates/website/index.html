  <h1>Why is it important to check Diabetes</h1>
  <p>Many people who live with diabetes don’t feel any particular symptoms, unless they are experiencing hyperglycemia (glucose level is too high) or hypoglycemia (glucose level is too low). Hyperglycemia can cause significant damage to some organs, which then leads to complications of diabetes. These include:
    <ul>
      <li><p> cardiac or vascular event, such as myocardial infarction (heart attack) or stroke;</p></li>
      <li><p>problems that may require dialysis;
      <li><p>eye problems, which may lead to loss of vision (blindness);</p></li>
      <li><p>sexual issues, such as erectile dysfunction;</p></li>
      <li><p>problems with circulation and scarring, which can lead to amputation.</p></li>
      <li><p>To avoid the complications of diabetes, you must control your blood glucose very well to minimize the risk of hyperglycemia. This will allow you to prevent the complications of diabetes.</p></li>
      
    </ul>
    Monitoring your glucose levels daily, also known as self-testing, is an essential part of managing diabetes, just like changing lifestyle habits and taking medication. It allows you to see the impact of the measures you are taking to better control your diabetes, including:
    <ul>
      <li><p>changes made to your diet;</p></li>
      <li><p>losing weight;</p></li>
      <li><p>doing physical activity;</p></li>
      <li><p>taking medication.</p></li>
      
    </ul>
    When you blood-glucose meter indicates that your levels are too high, you can take the required measures to bring it back to normal right away. This can involve modifying your diet (for example, avoiding certain foods) or increasing your medicine.

  <h1 style="text-align: center;">Are Diabetes genetical</h1>
  <center><img style="width: 50%;" src="{% static 'website/image6.jpg'%}" alt=""></center>
    <p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease. It occurs when the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy cells. This type often appears during adolescence, but a person can develop it at any age.</p>
    <p> However, not everyone with type 1 diabetes has a family history of it.

      Genetics Home Reference suggests that some genetic features may make type 1 diabetes more likely to develop under certain circumstances.</p>
    <p>Type 2 diabetes It is the most common type, accounting for about 90–95 percentTrusted Source of all diabetes cases in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p>
    <p>As with type 1 diabetes, people with type 2 often have a close family member with the condition.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><h6>If you are a man with type 1 diabetes, the odds of your child developing diabetes are 1 in 17. If you are a woman with type 1 diabetes and your child was born before you were 25, your child's risk is 1 in 25; if your child was born after you turned 25, your child's risk is 1 in 100.</h6>
      </li>
      <li><h6>Type 2 diabetes runs in families. In part, this is due to children learning bad habits—eating a poor diet, not exercising—from their parents. But there is also a genetic basis. The good news is, like in adults, it is possible to delay or prevent type 2 diabetes in youth by encouraging healthy food choices, exercise and weight loss.</h6>
